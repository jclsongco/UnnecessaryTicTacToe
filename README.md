# Unnecessary Tic Tac Toe!

This is basically just normal tic tac toe but you can adjust how many cells you want. 
The number you input will be the number of cells per row and column. 

Basic tic tac toe game is 3. This program is coded to handle even 4 x 4 and above games. There is no practical use - just for fun haha. 

Controls: 
To enter an X or O, just **click**. There is also an indicator near the cursor on whos turn it is. 

Press **ENTER** as specified to enter the number of cells. (and to move from input screen to game screen and vice versa)

Press **ESCAPE** during a game if you want to exit it prematurely. 

That's all thanks!
